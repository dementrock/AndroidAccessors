AndroidAccessors
================

IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin to generate proper getters and setters for Android.

Android convention dictates that private member variables be prefaced with an 'm', but the default code generation `Getter and Setter` doesn't handle this so gracefully.  AndroidAccessors provides an alternative which generates much cleaner external methods.

AndroidAccessors now supports private static fields with a leading 's' (as per Google's [Code Style Guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)).

Installation
------------

Using IntelliJ's built-in plugin system:

`Preferences > Plugins > Browse repositories... > Search for "AndroidAccessors" > Install Plugin`

or alternatively, download the .jar and install it manually.

Usage
-----

`Code > Generate ...` will bring up the code generation menu â€” the default keymapping is `ctrl N` on OS X.  Select `AndroidAccessors` from the menu and it will display a list of all fields in the current class.  Remove any fields you don't need methods for by using the minus sign (-) and click 'OK' to finish.
